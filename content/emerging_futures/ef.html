      <h1>Emerging Futures</h1>
<!--       <p>Research on emerging technologies including Artificial General Intelligence, Voice Recognition, andVirtual Reality.</p> -->
      <p>We have not yet created a machine that is capable of all human brain functions. When imagining a word in which this is achieved, many are concerned that these machines will take over. Because AGI technology would mean that the machines improve exponentially each time they make a mistake, they would quickly become more powerful and more intelligent than the human brain. What if we become dependent on the AGI robots and they decide to strike? Imagine if these robots had bad intentions? What could happen?</p>

              An immediate fear of losing our privacy is what first came to my mind when thinking about AGI robots. If we begin to allow these types of technologies into our homes, they will have access to all of our information and behavioral patterns. They would be able to store information (memory) about our interactions with them, as well as our interactions around them. It would be similar to constant surveillance. This collage addresses these concerns. There is a “man” sitting down, with a camera replacing his brain. This is overplayed with an x-ray image of the inside of the brain, showing his “real” brain stemming from the top of the camera. This is to symbolize a theory that the AGI “brain” would not be a just brain or machine making decisions, but would be stemming from a type of surveillance system. This collage also shows a TV with a camera on top of it. The original image shows the view of the camera on the TV - the two outlets are displayed on screen. Instead, these two cords in the outlets are shown on the lower right inside of another x-ray brain image.

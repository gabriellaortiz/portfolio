  <h1>Instruction Sets for Strangers</h1>
  <p>While working on a team, we designed and implemented a site specific intervention that enabled stranger interaction. For each iteration, we did not use written instructions, challenging us to design with intuition in mind. Our chosen space was Tompkins Square Park, which has an extensive history of protests and riots. Through the years, it has been an important place for many subcultures in our community.</p>

  <h2>Iteration 01</h2>
  <p>
    Mini “create your own picket sign” station<br>
    Many people passed by but no one interacted<br>
    Change location, make table more prominent in space<br>

  <h2>Iteration 02</h2>
  <p>
    Building blocks wrapped in newspaper<br>
    Many interactions, blocks knocked down, then picked up by others<br>
    Test new locations, box sizes and box formations<br>
  </p>

  <h2>Iteration 03</h2>
  <p>
    Larger blocks wrapped in newspaper<br>
    No interactions due to weather and material restrictions<br>
    Waterproof boxes, check events calendar before implementation date<br>
  </p>

  <p>Overall, our second iteration was my favorite. The interaction of community members knocking the structure down to have other members pick it up was interesting. In the future I look forward to completing another project based on this observation.</p>

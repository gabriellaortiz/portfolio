            <h2>AGI Protective Charm</h2>
            <p>
              Imagining a world in which AGI exists can be scary when you consider the negative possibilities. AGI would mean that there are robots growing exponentially “smarter” than the smartest human brain by the day. Just like there are humans with good and bad intentions, what happens if a robot smarter than the smartest human decides to destroy our planet? If their actions are beyond human understanding, it seems that the only thing we can do is protect ourselves any way we can. If we try to create a protective technology, the malicious AGI can quickly outsmart and destroy our progress. What if we considered going back to old methods, drawing on legends and using symbolic charms to protect us?

              This charm is based on the Ojibwa legend of a mystical “Spider Woman” who was the spiritual protector for the tribe. The story is that as the tribe expanded, the Spider woman was unable to spread herself wide enough to protect everyone. Instead, she created a web for each person to keep over their bed and catch the “evil” spirits in the air that would cause them bad dreams. This evolved into the dreamcatcher which was then used by mothers and grandmothers to protect their children and families from evil spirits. Similar to this story, the charm I have created is based on the shapes of neurons in the human brain. AGI robots would be capable of human brain function, but they would not have their own real human brains. This neuron charm would protect the wearer against the evils of AGI robots and the possible negative effects of this technology.

			<!--       <p>Research on emerging technologies including Artificial General Intelligence, Voice Recognition, andVirtual Reality.</p> -->
			<p>We have not yet created a machine that is capable of all human brain functions. When imagining a word in which this is achieved, many are concerned that these machines will take over. Because AGI technology would mean that the machines improve exponentially each time they make a mistake, they would quickly become more powerful and more intelligent than the human brain. What if we become dependent on the AGI robots and they decide to strike? Imagine if these robots had bad intentions? What could happen?</p>

				<h2>AGI Dystopia Collage</h2>            
				<p>
					An immediate fear of losing our privacy is what first came to my mind when thinking about AGI robots. If we begin to allow these types of technologies into our homes, they will have access to all of our information and behavioral patterns. They would be able to store information (memory) about our interactions with them, as well as our interactions around them. It would be similar to constant surveillance. This collage addresses these concerns. There is a “man” sitting down, with a camera replacing his brain. This is overplayed with an x-ray image of the inside of the brain, showing his “real” brain stemming from the top of the camera. This is to symbolize a theory that the AGI “brain” would not be a just brain or machine making decisions, but would be stemming from a type of surveillance system. This collage also shows a TV with a camera on top of it. The original image shows the view of the camera on the TV - the two outlets are displayed on screen. Instead, these two cords in the outlets are shown on the lower right inside of another x-ray brain image.

				<h2>AGI Protective Charm</h2>
<!--         <p>
                    Imagining a world in which AGI exists can be scary when you consider the negative possibilities. AGI would mean that there are robots growing exponentially “smarter” than the smartest human brain by the day. Just like there are humans with good and bad intentions, what happens if a robot smarter than the smartest human decides to destroy our planet? If their actions are beyond human understanding, it seems that the only thing we can do is protect ourselves any way we can. If we try to create a protective technology, the malicious AGI can quickly outsmart and destroy our progress. What if we considered going back to old methods, drawing on legends and using symbolic charms to protect us?

        </p> -->
				<p>
					This charm is based on the Ojibwa legend of a mystical “Spider Woman” who was the spiritual protector for the tribe. The story is that as the tribe expanded, the Spider woman was unable to spread herself wide enough to protect everyone. Instead, she created a web for each person to keep over their bed and catch the “evil” spirits in the air that would cause them bad dreams. This evolved into the dreamcatcher which was then used by mothers and grandmothers to protect their children and families from evil spirits. Similar to this story, the charm I have created is based on the shapes of neurons in the human brain. AGI robots would be capable of human brain function, but they would not have their own real human brains. This neuron charm would protect the wearer against the evils of AGI robots and the possible negative effects of this technology.

      <h1>Injury</h1>
      <p>Intrigued by the human ability to survive and live on after injuries and immense pain, I decided to respond with a photo series – turned – book. I took images in a documentary style of things that caught my eye while walking around over the course of two weeks. Afterwards, I asked my friends and others around me to describe the first painful memory that came to mind and wrote them all down in my sketchbook and scanned my writing. I then paired each story with an image that slightly relates to or juxtaposes the story. All the images are soft and happy feeling, to magnify the harshness of the handwritten stories underneath. The book is named Injury because I noticed that not one person recounted an emotionally painful memory – all of the stories were about physical pain, which is the pain that this word usually describes.</p>
